This problem demonstrates a Monte Carlo Simulation â€” a type of static simulation used to estimate probabilities using random sampling. The example models a squadron of bombers attempting to hit an ammunition depot. Each bombâ€™s landing point is determined by random variations in the horizontal and vertical directions, following a normal distribution.

How It Works The ammunition depot is represented as a polygon (either entered through coordinates or drawn manually).

Each bombâ€™s impact point (X, Y) is generated using:

X=Zxâ€‹Ã—Ïƒxâ€‹,Y=Zyâ€‹Ã—Ïƒyâ€‹â€‹

where Zx, Zy are random normal numbers.

The program checks if each bomb lands inside the depot â€” counting hits and misses.

The simulation results are displayed in a table and scatter plot with red (hits) and blue (misses).

Features

Interactive GUI using CustomTkinter.

Two input options:
Type coordinates manually.
Draw the depot polygon directly.

Displays visual results, hit probability, and execution time.



ðŸ§  Purpose

This problem shows how Monte Carlo methods can simulate real-world uncertainty â€” in this case, the inaccuracy of bomb drops â€” and estimate the probability of successful hits.
